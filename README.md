# Fullstack dev tech challenge

Hi, and welcome to our tech challenge for full stack devs.
This challenge is intended to allow you to showcase your tech skills both on front-end and back-end tasks.

## Project setup

You will need to install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [AWS SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) first.

Then, you can get everything set up with a simple install command in the project directory:

```
npm install
```

### Serving

Once you've set up the project, you can run the front and back apps with the serve command:

```
npm run serve
```

### Running the unit tests
```
npm run test
```

## Challenges

1) There are broken unit tests on both front and back-end apps. Find the problems and fix them so that the tests pass.
2) Serve the app open it in a browser. Note that there is an issue between front-end and back-end. Fix that issue and
   capture a screenshot of the app fully loaded in your browser.
3) Implement a new back-end lambda. The lambda can do whatever you like, extra points for creativity!
4) Call the lambda from the front end and display the result.
5) Style the app to make it look nice, and capture a second screenshot.

## Finishing up

After you've completed the challenges, zip up your changed code, include the screenshots and send it to andy@fivevectors.io.
